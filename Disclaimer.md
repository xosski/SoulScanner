## ⚰️ Final Note

Once it’s on GitHub, we can:
- Add issues/roadmap
- Write a `--json` export mode
- Add CI to scan uploaded samples
- Turn it into a proper Linux utility (`bin/soulscan` anyone?)

Want me to prep the folder structure and README scaffold for upload? I’ll zip it faster than your cache file can scream.

# Scan a Chrome cache folder

bash SoulScanner.sh
ðŸ§Ÿ What It Does
For each file it encounters, the scanner will:

Identify file type and MIME

Check for code-like structure and assign a Codiness score (0â€“15)

Detect and recursively unpack:

GZIP-compressed files

ZIP archives

Base64 blocks

Attempt naive AES-128 decryption (placeholder for now)

Detect high-entropy blobs (potential encryption/malware)

Log English language content

Record everything in a structured log file

ðŸ§¾ Output Sample
yaml
Copy
Edit
ðŸ§¾ [L0] File: strange_payload.gz
Signature: 1f8b080000000000...
ðŸ“„ MIME type: application/gzip
Found: ðŸ—œ GZIP-compressed file. Decompressing...
ðŸ§¾ [L1] File: decoded_L0_strange_payload.gz
Codiness: 12/15 ðŸ§¾ (likely code)
Contains: ðŸš¨ Code-Like Structures
ðŸ’€ Exit Prompt
After scanning, the script waits for you to press ENTER before closing the terminal.
So you can actually read your sins before the shell eats them.
